Comparison based DNA tests with user determined error tolerance; processing of FASTA files. Completed for a project at UCLA.

data		Includes real FASTA files
test_files	Includes small files to be used for testing

Note: You must hardcode the directory path to your FASTA files correctly (see the data folder for some FASTA files), otherwise the program won't be able to find/load them.
